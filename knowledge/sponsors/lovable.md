## Hackathon Perk
- Everyone receives 100 credits; additional credits for top 3 teams.

## Product Snapshot
- AI-powered builder that turns natural-language prompts into editable full-stack apps (frontend + backend).
- Supports Agent Mode (auto-build) and Chat Mode (assistant without code changes).
- Export code to GitHub; edit visually or via Dev Mode.

## Quickstart
1. Describe your app idea in plain English; iterate with specific follow-up prompts (see Prompting guide).
2. Use visual edits for layout tweaks; switch to Dev Mode for code adjustments.
3. Export to GitHub when you need custom backend logic, extra packages, or deployment pipelines.

## Integrations & Tips
- Native integrations: GitHub, Supabase, Stripe, OpenAI/Anthropic, etc.
- Reuse community templates to accelerate prototypes.
- Keep prompts precise (data models, user flows); follow the CLEAR prompting pattern.
- Leverage built-in auth and CRUD scaffolding to save time during the hack.

## Plain English
- Tell it what to build (“a simple waitlist with email signup and admin view”), then refine.
- If stuck, ask for “show me the files you changed” or “add unit tests for X”.
